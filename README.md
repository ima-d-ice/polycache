# PolyCache
**C++17** • **Epoll** • **SIEVE / LRU / LFU** • **AOF Persistence**

A high-performance in-memory cache server written in C++17 with hot-swappable eviction policies and a rigorous statistical benchmarking harness.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network I/O** | Single-threaded `epoll` event loop (macOS `poll` compat), non-blocking I/O |
| **Eviction Policies** | Hand-rolled SIEVE (NSDI 2024), LRU, LFU (behind a unified `EvictionPolicy` interface) |
| **Persistence** | Synchronous AOF (Append-Only File) with JSON-line formatting and crash replay |
| **Dependencies** | `nlohmann/json` (vendored single header) |
| **Testing** | Plain C++17 assertions (`CHECK` macros), zero external test frameworks |

## Core Features

* **Runtime Policy Switching:** A single `SWITCH_POLICY` TCP command swaps between SIEVE, LRU, and LFU live. The rebuild preserves the eviction frontier (metadata sort, not a flush), ensuring zero data loss and no downtime.
* **Modern Eviction (SIEVE):** Implements the 2024 SIEVE algorithm, which uses a single hand pointer to clear visited bits, offering $O(1)$ amortized operations and superior scan-resistance compared to LRU.
* **Durability by Design:** Prioritizes data safety over write throughput via synchronous `fsync`-per-write AOF logging.
* **Admin & Metrics:** A background worker thread runs an HTTP server exposing live cache metrics (`/metrics`) and health checks (`/health`).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the server and run unit tests
make
make test

# Start the server (Defaults: port 6379, admin 8080, 64MB limit)
./polycache --memory-limit 64 --aof-file polycache.aof
```

*Note: Graceful shutdown is triggered by `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`.*

## Protocol & API Reference

PolyCache speaks **two protocols on the same TCP port** (default `6379`, the
Redis port). Request detection is per-frame: a frame beginning with `*` is
parsed as **RESP2** (Redis Serialization Protocol — arrays of binary-safe bulk
strings, pipelines supported); anything else falls back to the legacy
line protocol (`VERB arg arg\r\n`). Both produce identical RESP-shaped
responses, so the server is a drop-in target for `redis-benchmark` and
`redis-cli`.

### TCP Commands

| Command | RESP / line form | Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SET key value [ttl]` | `SET key value [EX secs\|PX ms]` | `+OK` |
| `GET key` | `GET key` | `$<len>\r\n<value>` (hit) or `$-1` (miss) |
| `DEL key` | `DEL key` | `:1` (removed) or `:0` (absent) |
| `PING [msg]` | `PING [msg]` | `+PONG` (or bulk echo of `msg`) |
| `SELECT db` | `SELECT db` | `+OK` (single-database, ignored) |
| `SWITCH_POLICY lru\|lfu\|sieve` | `SWITCH_POLICY sieve` | `+OK` (Atomic swap under storage lock) |
| `METRICS` | `METRICS` | bulk string of cache stats JSON |

```bash
# Legacy line protocol via netcat
printf 'SET user:42 alice 60\r\nGET user:42\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 6379

# RESP2 via redis-cli (same port)
redis-cli -p 6379 SET user:42 alice
redis-cli -p 6379 GET user:42
```

### Redis-benchmark comparison

Because the wire format is RESP2, PolyCache can be benchmarked head-to-head with
Redis using the official `redis-benchmark` tool:

```bash
# Run the 4-scenario matrix (PolyCache vs Redis, strict memory limit):
python3 tools/bench_redis.py --mem-limit-mb 64 --keyspace 1000000

# Or a single ad-hoc run:
redis-benchmark -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -t set,get,ping -n 100000 -r 1000000
```

`tools/bench_redis.py` pins each PolyCache policy against the closest Redis
`allkeys-*` policy (`lru`↔`allkeys-lru`, `sieve`/`lfu`↔`allkeys-lfu`), forces a
keyspace far larger than the cache so eviction actually fires, and reports
per-command throughput (req/s) plus live hit-rate for both sides.

> Note: the benchmark runs PolyCache with `--no-aof`, which disables the
> synchronous per-write fsync so throughput reflects protocol/CPU cost. With
> AOF on (the default, durability-by-design), `SET` throughput is intentionally
> fsync-bound. `redis-benchmark` v8 has no standalone `DEL` test, so the matrix
> covers `set`, `get`, `ping`.

### Admin HTTP API

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics
# {"evictions":12,"hit_rate":0.85,"hits":850,"memory_bytes":1048576,"policy":"sieve"}

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

## Performance & Benchmarking

Included is a Python benchmarking harness (`benchmark.py`) that starts a fresh server per mode, preloads the cache to capacity, and replays identical phased workloads to measure policy divergence under adversarial conditions.

### Workload Design
The workload forces the eviction frontier to walk the preload order via 50% cold-write churn. A "burst pool" at the tail of the preload is read once and left to idle; LRU drops these keys under churn, while LFU and SIEVE retain them due to frequency and visited-bit protections.

### Benchmark Results (90K requests, 1MB cache, 5 seeds)
SIEVE and LFU tie and consistently outperform LRU in scan-heavy phases.

| Mode | Overall Hit Rate (mean ± std) | P1 (Zipf) | P2 (Scan) | P3 (Mixed) |

| **static_sieve** | **0.3041 ± 0.0502** | 0.2890 | 0.2293 | **0.3868** |
| **static_lfu** | **0.3041 ± 0.0502** | 0.2890 | 0.2293 | **0.3868** |
| static_lru | 0.1630 ± 0.0508 | 0.2885 | 0.0846 | 0.1200 |
